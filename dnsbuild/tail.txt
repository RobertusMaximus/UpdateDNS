// From the release notes:
//  Because many of our users are uncomfortable receiving undelegated answers
//  from root or top level domains, other than a few for whom that behaviour
//  has been trusted and expected for quite some length of time, we have now
//  introduced the "root-delegations-only" feature which applies delegation-only
//  logic to all top level domains, and to the root domain.  An exception list
//  should be specified, including "MUSEUM" and "DE", and any other top level
//  domains from whom undelegated responses are expected and trusted.
// root-delegation-only exclude { "DE"; "MUSEUM"; };
